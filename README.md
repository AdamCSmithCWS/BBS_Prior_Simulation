# BBS_Prior_Simulation
Prior simulations on some of the BBS trend models

Most of the published Bayesian models for trends from the North American Breeding Bird Survey have used "non-informative" priors. But these priors may be informative in unexpected ways because they are mostly so wide as to include significant prior mass at parameter values that are effectively impossible (e.g., prior slope-trend parameter values that suggest annual rates of change >> 100%).

The goal here is to derive some priors that are more biologically reasonable given what we know about wild bird populations.

Ideally, such priors will help with model estimation (faster) and reduce improbably extreme estimates of parameters like trends and annual fluctuations when data are sparse.
